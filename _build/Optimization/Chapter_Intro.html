<h1 id="Optimization">Optimization<a class="anchor-link" href="#Optimization"> </a></h1><p>The goal of optimization is to maximize (or minimize) the value of a function (called objective function) subject to a number of restrictions (called constraints). It is of fundamental importance in wide variety of fields throughout science, engineering, finance.</p>
<p>Here we will give a brief overview on the manual implementation of <em>gradient-based optimizers</em> without constraints. We will also introduce one of the many Julia optimization packages, <code>Optim</code>.</p>
